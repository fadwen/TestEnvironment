function New-OktaUser {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates the seeded Okta users from Data\OktaUsers.csv

    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates eight users, which is not an arbitrary number: the Okta Integrator Free Plan
        licenses ten active users and your own admin account is one of them, so eight is what
        fits with a slot left over for a colleague or a second admin.

        Because there are only eight, each one has to earn its place. They differ from each
        other along the axes that actually break scripts:

        - Three carry non-ASCII names (José Niño, Zoë Müller, Tomás Álvarez) while their
          logins stay ASCII, which is what a real directory looks like. Windows PowerShell
          writes CSV as ASCII unless told otherwise and silently replaces those characters
          with question marks, so without them that data loss is invisible.
        - Three lifecycle states: active, suspended and staged. A staged user has never signed
          in and has no established credentials, but it still counts against the tenant's
          active user licence and it is still evaluated by group rules. Both of those were
          verified against a real tenant, and both are the opposite of what people assume.
        - Two contractors with an end date, and six permanent staff without one, so empty
          optional attributes are represented rather than assumed away.
        - A manager chain three deep, so a script that resolves managers has something to
          resolve.

        The function is re-runnable. An existing login is updated rather than duplicated,
        which matters when a seed run fails partway and you want to fix the cause and run it
        again rather than tear down first.

    .PARAMETER UserCount
        How many users to create, taken from the top of the CSV. Lower it if the tenant is
        already holding users you want to keep.

    .PARAMETER AccountPassword
        Password for the seeded accounts, as a SecureString. Defaults to a known, shared, weak
        value. That is deliberate: these are lab accounts and being able to sign in as one is
        usually the point. Pass your own to override it.

        A password is always set, even on the staged user, because creating an Okta user
        without credentials makes Okta send a real activation email to the address on the
        profile.

    .PARAMETER SkipLifecycleStates
        Create every user active, ignoring the Suspended and Staged states in the CSV. Useful
        when you want eight uniformly usable accounts and not the awkward ones.

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return the detailed result object

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject with TotalUsers, CreatedUsers, UpdatedUsers, Users and Errors

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaUser
        Creates all eight users in their CSV-defined lifecycle states

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaUser -UserCount 4 -SkipLifecycleStates -PassThru
        Creates four uniformly active users, leaving six licence slots free

    .EXAMPLE
        $password = Read-Host 'Lab password' -AsSecureString
        New-OktaUser -AccountPassword $password
