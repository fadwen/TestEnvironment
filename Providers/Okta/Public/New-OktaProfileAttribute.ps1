    .SYNOPSIS
        Adds the module's custom attributes to the Okta user schemas

    .DESCRIPTION
        Okta's base user profile is fixed. Anything beyond it lives in the custom section of a
        user type's schema, and it has to exist before a user can be created carrying it, so
        this runs early in the seed order and late in the teardown order.

        The attributes are chosen for type coverage rather than realism. A lab whose profile is
        nothing but strings will not tell you that your export flattens an array to
        "System.Object[]", that your CSV writer turns a boolean into "True" where the API wanted
        true, or that a risk score of zero is falsy in PowerShell and gets dropped by an
        `if ($value)` guard. Each of those has a corresponding attribute here.

        Attributes are grouped by user type, because each type has its OWN schema at its own
        path. Two of them - labAgencyName and labPurchaseOrder - exist only on the Contractor
        type, which means an export that reads the default schema genuinely cannot see them.
        That is the point of the second type existing.

        One attribute, labSeedTag, is infrastructure rather than test data: it is what
        Remove-OktaEnvironment uses to be certain a user was created by this module and not
        by you.

        The schema API replaces the properties it is given and leaves the rest alone, so this is
        safe to re-run. -Remove sets each property to null, which is how Okta deletes a custom
        attribute; there is no DELETE for these.

    .PARAMETER Attribute
        Restrict the operation to these attribute names. Defaults to everything in
        Data\OktaProfileAttributes.csv.

    .PARAMETER Remove
        Set the attributes to null, deleting them from the schema. Any user still carrying a
        value loses it, so this must run after the users are gone.

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return the detailed result object

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject with Applied, Removed, Skipped and Errors

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaProfileAttribute
        Adds every attribute defined in the CSV, to whichever schema each belongs to

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaProfileAttribute -Attribute labRiskScore, labEntitlements -PassThru
        Adds only the two attributes whose types tend to break exports

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaProfileAttribute -Remove -WhatIf
        Shows which attributes teardown would delete from the schemas

        Editing the default user type's schema affects every user in the tenant, including your
        own admin account. On a shared tenant, prefer a dedicated user type.

        Attributes on a non-default type need that type to exist, so run New-OktaUserType
        first, or let New-OktaEnvironment order it for you.
