    .SYNOPSIS
        Clears the stored Okta connection

    .DESCRIPTION
        Drops the API token or access token held in the session. Worth running when you are
        finished, because until you do, the credential sits in a module-scoped variable that
        anything else in the session can read.

        Removing the module clears it too. This exists so you do not have to remove the module
        to drop a credential you no longer want loaded.

    .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-OktaEnvironment
