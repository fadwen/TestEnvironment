function Get-OktaServiceApp {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Shows where the service app credential is stored and how it is protected

    .DESCRIPTION
        Answers "where did the key actually go, and is it encrypted?" without having to open a
        JSON file and interpret it.

        The private key is deliberately NOT returned by default. Everything this module does
        with the key it does internally - Get-OktaAccessToken signs an assertion and hands
        back a token - so there is no ordinary workflow that needs the raw key in a variable,
        and a function that returns one by default is a function that puts one in transcripts
        and scrollback. -IncludePrivateKey is there for the case where you genuinely need to
        move the key into another tool, and it asks first.

    .PARAMETER CredentialPath
        Path to the credential file. Defaults to the per-user location for the connected org.

    .PARAMETER OrgUrl
        Org whose credential to look up. Defaults to the connected org.

    .PARAMETER VaultPassword
        Password used to unlock the SecretStore vault, when the credential is stored in one

    .PARAMETER IncludePrivateKey
        Also return the private JWK. Prompts for confirmation, because the returned object then
        contains a live admin credential.

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject describing the credential

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-OktaServiceApp
        Shows the client id, scopes, storage location and protection method

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-OktaServiceApp -IncludePrivateKey -Confirm:$false | Select-Object -Expand PrivateJwk
        Extracts the raw key, for moving it into another tool

        Protection values:
        - DPAPI       encrypted into the file, bound to this user and machine (the default)
        - SecretStore encrypted in a vault; the file holds only a pointer
        - None        unprotected, guarded only by file permissions
