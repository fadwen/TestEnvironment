    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates the OAuth service app that replaces the SSWS token for later runs

    .DESCRIPTION
        Registers an API Services app in the tenant, authenticating with private_key_jwt, and
        writes its private key to a protected file so every later run can authenticate as the
        app instead of as you.

        The reason this exists rather than just reusing the SSWS token: an SSWS token carries
        the permissions of the human who created it, never expires on its own, and is a bearer
        string that ends up pasted into scripts and scrollback. A service app key is scoped to
        exactly the Okta APIs it was granted, is never transmitted (only assertions signed by
        it are), and can be revoked by deleting one app. Once this has run, the SSWS token has
        done its job and can be revoked in the admin console.

        Four calls make up the registration, and all four are needed:

        1. POST /oauth2/v1/clients registers the client with the public half of a freshly
           generated RSA key.
        2. POST /api/v1/apps/{id}/grants grants each Okta API scope. Without these the app
           gets a token that every management endpoint then rejects.
        3. POST /oauth2/v1/clients/{id}/roles assigns an admin role. Scopes say which APIs
           the app may call; the role says which objects it may touch. An app with scopes and
           no role authenticates successfully and is authorised for nothing, which is a
           genuinely confusing failure.
        4. The private key is written locally, with its ACL replaced so only you can read it.

        The private key is generated here and the public half is what leaves the machine. Okta
        never sees the private key, and neither does anything else.

    .PARAMETER Label
        The app label shown in the admin console. Defaults to the connection prefix followed
        by a description, so teardown can find it without the credential file.

    .PARAMETER Scope
        Okta API scopes to grant. The default set is what this module itself needs to seed and
        tear down an environment. Narrow it if the app is only ever going to read.

    .PARAMETER AdminRole
        Standard admin roles to assign. SUPER_ADMIN is the default because managing the user
        schema, which this module does, is a super admin operation, and because the tenant
        this is aimed at is a disposable one. On anything you care about, assign USER_ADMIN
        and APP_ADMIN instead and accept that -Skip Schema becomes mandatory.

    .PARAMETER CredentialPath
        Where to write the credential. Defaults to a per-user file outside the repository.

    .PARAMETER UseSecretStore
        Store the private key in a PowerShell SecretStore vault instead of encrypting it into
        the credential file, installing SecretManagement and SecretStore if they are missing.

        The file-based default already encrypts the key with DPAPI on Windows, so this is not
        about plaintext-versus-encrypted. Reach for it when you want the key in the same vault
        as the rest of your lab credentials, when you want a password you chose rather than a
        machine-bound key, or when you are on Linux or macOS, where DPAPI does not exist and the
        file default degrades to unprotected.

    .PARAMETER VaultName
        Vault to use when -UseSecretStore is specified

    .PARAMETER VaultPassword
        Password for the vault when -UseSecretStore is specified. Defaults to a known lab value
        so that unattended runs are not blocked by a prompt.

    .PARAMETER KeySize
        RSA key size in bits

    .PARAMETER RevokeApiToken
        Name or id of an SSWS API token to revoke once the service app has proven it can issue
        a token. Use it to retire the bootstrap credential in the same command that replaces it.

        You have to name the token, because the module cannot work out which one it is using.
        /api/v1/api-tokens/current returns 404 on a standard org, and the list endpoint returns
        ids and names but never token values, so an SSWS string cannot be matched to a row. Orgs
        routinely hold several tokens serving Terraform, Postman and CI, and a guess would
        eventually revoke one of those.

        Three interlocks: nothing is revoked unless the new app has successfully issued a token,
        an ambiguous name is refused rather than resolved, and -WhatIf is honoured. Revocation
        is permanent - Okta cannot restore a token or recreate one with the same value.

        Note that rotating this app's key later needs an SSWS token, since okta.clients.manage
        is deliberately withheld from the app. Keep at least one token, or accept that a
        replacement is made by hand in the admin console.

    .PARAMETER Force
        Delete an existing app with the same label first. Needed because re-registering
        produces a second app rather than replacing the first, and because the credential file
        for the old app stops working the moment it is superseded.

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return the detailed result object

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject with ClientId, AppId, Label, Scopes, AdminRoles, CredentialPath and
        Warnings

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaServiceApp
        Creates the app with the default scopes and writes the key to the default location

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaServiceApp -Scope okta.users.read, okta.groups.read -AdminRole READ_ONLY_ADMIN
        A read-only companion app, for testing a reporting script under least privilege

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaServiceApp -Force -PassThru
        Rotates the key by replacing the app

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaServiceApp -RevokeApiToken 'bootstrap' -WhatIf
        Shows which token would be revoked, without creating or revoking anything

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaServiceApp -RevokeApiToken 'bootstrap'
        Creates the app and retires the SSWS token that created it, once the app has proven
        itself by issuing a token

        Requires an SSWS connection held by a super admin. Assigning an admin role to a client
        is a super admin operation; a lesser token gets through the app creation and then
        fails on the role, leaving an app that cannot do anything.
