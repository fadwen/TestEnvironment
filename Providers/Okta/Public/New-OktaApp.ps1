    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates the seeded app integrations and assigns groups and users to them

    .DESCRIPTION
        Users and groups answer "who". Apps are what turn that into "who has access to what",
        which is the question Okta actually exists to answer and the one most scripts written
        against it are trying to report on. Without app integrations a seeded tenant cannot
        exercise assignment, entitlement reporting, access reviews, or the offboarding question
        "what can this leaver still reach".

        Eight apps, and like the groups they are free: the Integrator Free Plan caps active
        users at ten but does not cap apps, so this is where an eight-user tenant gets to look
        like a real one.

        The assignments are the point, not the apps. They cover the shapes that break reports:

        - An app assigned to everyone, so a report returning nobody is obviously wrong.
        - An app reached through two overlapping groups, which a naive union double-counts.
        - A direct assignee who is NOT in the assigned group. Group-only reports miss them
          entirely, and that is the most common access-review bug there is.
        - A user assigned both directly and through a group, so the two scopes have to be
          told apart rather than merged.
        - An app assigned to nobody at all.

        Three sign-on modes are used: BOOKMARK, BROWSER_PLUGIN (SWA, password-vaulted) and
        OPENID_CONNECT (a real client with a secret). Custom SAML apps are deliberately absent
        because Okta does not permit creating them through the API - every documented template
        name returns 404 - so they have to be made in the admin console. That was verified
        against a live tenant rather than assumed.

    .PARAMETER AppName
        Restrict the operation to these CSV app names, for example Wiki. The prefix is added
        automatically, so pass the bare name.

    .PARAMETER SkipAssignment
        Create the apps but assign nobody to them

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return the detailed result object

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject with TotalApps, CreatedApps, ExistingApps, GroupsAssigned, UsersAssigned,
        Apps and Errors

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaApp
        Creates every app and applies its assignments

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaApp -SkipAssignment -PassThru
        Creates the app shells only, for testing an assignment script against

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaApp -AppName Wiki, Payroll -WhatIf

        Groups and users are matched by name and login, so run New-OktaGroup and
        New-OktaUser first. An assignment that does not resolve is reported and skipped
        rather than failing the app.
