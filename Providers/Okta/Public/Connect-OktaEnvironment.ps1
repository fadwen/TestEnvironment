function Connect-OktaEnvironment {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Establishes the Okta connection every other function in the module uses

    .DESCRIPTION
        Two authentication modes, and the order between them is the whole point of the
        module's design:

        1. -ApiToken, an SSWS token created by hand in the admin console. This is the
           bootstrap. It is the only credential that exists before anything has been created,
           and it is the one that can create the service app.
        2. -ServiceApp, the OAuth service app created by New-OktaServiceApp. From the
           second run onward this is what you use, and the SSWS token can be revoked.

        The connection is validated before it is stored. A bad token that is accepted here and
        rejected on the first real call gives you an error about users when the problem is the
        credential, so the cheapest possible request is made up front.

        Prefix and EmailDomain are recorded on the connection rather than passed to every
        function. They are what teardown keys off, so having them set once, at connect time,
        removes the failure mode where an environment is seeded under one prefix and torn down
        under another.

    .PARAMETER OrgUrl
        The org URL, for example https://trial-123456.okta.com. Both the admin host
        (-admin.okta.com) and a trailing slash are tolerated and normalised away, because both
        are what you get from copying the address bar.

    .PARAMETER ApiToken
        An SSWS API token as a SecureString. Create one under Security > API > Tokens in the
        admin console. The token inherits the permissions of the admin who created it, so a
        super admin's token is needed to create the service app and assign it a role.

    .PARAMETER ServiceApp
        Authenticate with the saved service app credential instead of an SSWS token

    .PARAMETER CredentialPath
        Path to the service app credential file. Defaults to the per-user location for this
        org.

    .PARAMETER Prefix
        Name prefix and seed tag for everything this module creates. Everything created and
        everything removed is scoped by it.

    .PARAMETER EmailDomain
        Domain for seeded user logins and emails. The default is under example.com, which RFC
        2606 reserves precisely so test data cannot deliver mail to a real recipient. Change
        it only if you own the domain you change it to.

    .PARAMETER ActiveUserLimit
        The tenant's active user ceiling. Ten matches the Okta Integrator Free Plan; raise it
        if this tenant is on a paid plan.

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return the connection object

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject describing the connection, when -PassThru is used

    .EXAMPLE
        $token = Read-Host 'SSWS token' -AsSecureString
        Connect-OktaEnvironment -OrgUrl https://trial-123456.okta.com -ApiToken $token
        First run: bootstrap with the API token

    .EXAMPLE
        Connect-OktaEnvironment -OrgUrl https://trial-123456.okta.com -ServiceApp
        Every run after that: authenticate as the app

    .EXAMPLE
        Connect-OktaEnvironment -OrgUrl https://trial-123456.okta.com -ApiToken $token `
            -Prefix CONTOSO -EmailDomain contoso-lab.example.com
        Seed under a different prefix, so two labs can share one tenant
