    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates the group rules that populate the automatic groups

    .DESCRIPTION
        Group rules are Okta's answer to dynamic membership: an expression over the user
        profile, evaluated by Okta, that maintains a group without anybody assigning anyone.
        Since Okta groups cannot nest, rules are the closest it gets to structural membership,
        and they are worth having in a lab because they fail in ways direct assignment does not.

        Three rules ship, each reading a different kind of attribute:

        - a boolean custom attribute (labIsContractor)
        - an enumerated custom attribute (labClearanceLevel)
        - a base attribute through an expression function (department)

        Two behaviours are worth knowing, both confirmed against a real tenant rather than
        assumed:

        - Rules are evaluated against staged and suspended users, not only active ones. The
          contractor rule picks up both seeded contractors even though one has never been
          activated and the other is suspended. That is worth knowing because it is the
          opposite of what "only active users are in scope" would suggest, and it means a
          rule granting an entitlement reaches accounts nobody has signed into.
        - Rules apply asynchronously. Membership appears a short while after activation rather
          than immediately, so a report run straight afterwards can understate it.

    .PARAMETER RuleName
        Restrict the operation to these CSV rule names. The prefix is added automatically.

    .PARAMETER SkipActivation
        Create the rules but leave them inactive. An inactive rule assigns nobody, which is a
        useful state to test a compliance report against.

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return the detailed result object

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject with TotalRules, CreatedRules, UpdatedRules, ActivatedRules, Rules and
        Errors

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaGroupRule

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaGroupRule -SkipActivation -PassThru
        Creates the rules inactive, so you can watch membership appear when you activate them

        The target groups must exist first, so run New-OktaGroup before this.
