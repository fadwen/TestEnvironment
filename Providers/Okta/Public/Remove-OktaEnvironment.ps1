function Remove-OktaEnvironment {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Removes everything this module created, in the order Okta will accept

    .DESCRIPTION
        Teardown is the half of a test environment that gets written badly, and on a tenant
        with ten user slots it is the half you run most often. Two things make it safe here.

        First, ownership is proven rather than assumed. Users must carry the labSeedTag
        attribute or sit under the seed email domain; groups must have both the name prefix
        and the seed marker in their description. Nothing is deleted because its name looked
        familiar.

        Second, the order is forced by Okta's own dependencies and runs in reverse of
        creation:

        1. Event hooks, trusted origins, policies and network zones. First, because Okta
           refuses to delete a zone that a policy rule still points at.
        2. Group rules, deactivated then deleted. A rule holding a group open will block the
           group's deletion.
        3. Users, deactivated then deleted. Okta needs both; a single DELETE on an active
           user only deactivates it.
        4. Groups.
        5. App integrations, deactivated then deleted. Kept separate from the service app,
           because -Keep ServiceApp is about retaining the credential you authenticate with
           and should not also strand eight lab apps you asked to be rid of.
        6. The service app, deactivated then deleted, and its private key with it.
        7. Linked object definitions. After the users, since removing a definition removes
           every link made with it.
        8. Custom profile attributes, nulled out of every schema. Removing an attribute that
           users still carry destroys their data, and it is what Get-OktaSeededUser
           identifies users by.
        9. User types. Genuinely last: a type cannot be deleted while a user is on it, and
           Okta returns a transient conflict for a while after its schema is touched, so this
           tolerates a retry.

        -WhatIf beats -Force. If both are passed nothing is deleted, because the only reason
        to pass -WhatIf is to find out what would happen.

    .PARAMETER Keep
        Components to leave alone. Valid values: UserTypes, Schema, Users, Groups, GroupRules,
        Apps, LinkedObjects, NetworkZones, Policies, TrustedOrigins, EventHooks, ServiceApp.

    .PARAMETER RemoveCredentialFile
        Also delete the local private key file. Off by default: the file is worthless once the
        app is gone, but deleting a key the user may have copied a path to is not something to
        do without being asked.

    .PARAMETER Force
        Skip the confirmation prompt. Has no effect under -WhatIf.

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return the detailed results object

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject with per-component Removed and Errors collections

    .EXAMPLE
        Remove-OktaEnvironment -WhatIf
        Lists every object that would be deleted. Worth running first, every time.

    .EXAMPLE
        Remove-OktaEnvironment -Force
        Tears the environment down without prompting

    .EXAMPLE
        Remove-OktaEnvironment -Keep ServiceApp, Schema -Force
        Clears the users, groups and rules but keeps the app you authenticate with, ready for
        an immediate re-seed

        User deletion is irreversible. Okta has no recycle bin.

        If you are connected as the service app and do not use -Keep ServiceApp, the app
        deletes the credential it is authenticating with. That works, because the access token
        already issued stays valid for the rest of the run, but the next connection attempt
        will fail until a new app is created with an SSWS token.
