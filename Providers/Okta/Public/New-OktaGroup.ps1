    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates the seeded Okta groups and assigns their members

    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates seventeen groups from Data\OktaGroups.csv. The tenant caps users at ten, not
        groups, so this is where the environment gets its complexity back: eight users spread
        across seventeen groups produce far more interesting membership shapes than eight
        users in eight groups.

        The shapes are chosen on purpose:

        - Overlapping membership. Tomás is in both Engineering and IT, so a script that
          assumes one department per user is wrong about him.
        - A group with exactly one member, and a group with none. Empty is the case reports
          get wrong, because a group that is empty and a group that failed to resolve look
          identical in most output.
        - Two groups whose display names are not ASCII, Zürich Site Access and Ingénierie
          Réseau, for the same reason the users have accented names.
        - Three groups reserved for group rules, never assigned to directly. If a rule stops
          working, its group empties out and the manually assigned ones do not, which makes
          the failure visible instead of ambiguous.

        Okta groups do not nest, so there is no group-inside-a-group structure to model here.
        Group rules are the nearest equivalent, and they live in New-OktaGroupRule.

        Existing groups are updated rather than duplicated, so this is safe to re-run.

    .PARAMETER GroupName
        Restrict the operation to these CSV group names, for example Dept-Engineering. The
        prefix is added automatically, so pass the bare name.

    .PARAMETER SkipMemberAssignment
        Create the groups but leave them empty

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return the detailed result object

    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject with TotalGroups, CreatedGroups, UpdatedGroups, MembersAdded, Groups
        and Errors

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaGroup
        Creates every group and assigns members

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaGroup -SkipMemberAssignment -PassThru
        Creates the group shells only, for testing an assignment script against

    .EXAMPLE
        New-OktaGroup -GroupName Dept-Engineering, Dept-Sales -WhatIf

        Members are matched to users by login, so run New-OktaUser first. A member that
        does not resolve is reported and skipped rather than failing the group.
