function Get-OktaSeededGroup {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Finds the groups this module created, and only those

    .DESCRIPTION
        Okta group profiles hold nothing but a name and a description, so there is no custom
        attribute to hang a seed tag on the way there is for users. Both markers therefore
        have to live in those two fields, and both are required rather than either:

        - the name starts with the prefix and a hyphen
        - the description ends with the seed marker

        Requiring both is the point. A real group could plausibly be called OKTALAB-Something
        after somebody copies a naming convention, and a real group could plausibly carry a
        description mentioning the module. A group with both was written by this module.

        Built-in groups are excluded by type: Everyone is a BUILT_IN group and deleting it is
        not possible anyway, but filtering to OKTA_GROUP keeps the intent visible.

    .PARAMETER Prefix
        The group name prefix to match

    .PARAMETER SeedMarker
        The description suffix that confirms ownership

    .OUTPUTS
        Array of Okta group objects

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-OktaSeededGroup -Prefix 'OKTALAB' -SeedMarker '[seed:OKTALAB]'
