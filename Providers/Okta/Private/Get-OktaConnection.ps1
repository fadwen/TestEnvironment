function Get-OktaConnection {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Returns the active Okta connection established by Connect-OktaEnvironment

    .DESCRIPTION
        Every function that talks to Okta calls this rather than reading the script variable
        directly, so there is exactly one place that decides what "not connected" means and
        exactly one error message for it.

    .PARAMETER AllowNone
        Return $null instead of throwing when no connection is established. Used by teardown
        and report paths that want to degrade rather than fail.

    .OUTPUTS
        Hashtable with OrgUrl, AuthorizationHeader, AuthType, Prefix, EmailDomain and
        ConnectedAt keys.

    .EXAMPLE
        $connection = Get-OktaConnection
        $connection.OrgUrl

    # A service app access token lives an hour, which is longer than a seed run but shorter
    # than a working session, and the symptom of letting it lapse is a 401 partway through a
    # teardown. Renewing here means every caller gets a live token without knowing about it.

    # explicit -Connection, so it never comes back through this function.
