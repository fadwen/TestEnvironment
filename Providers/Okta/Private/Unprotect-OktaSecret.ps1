    .SYNOPSIS
        Reverses Protect-OktaSecret

    .DESCRIPTION
        Reads the protection method recorded beside the value rather than guessing from the
        value's shape, so a DPAPI string and an unprotected one cannot be confused.

        The failure worth naming is a DPAPI blob that will not decrypt. That means the file was
        written by a different user or on a different machine, because DPAPI keys the secret to
        both. It is a common thing to hit after copying a profile or moving a lab between
        machines, and the raw CryptographicException says nothing about the cause, so it is
        translated here into the actual remedy.

    .PARAMETER Method
        The protection method recorded with the value: 'DPAPI' or 'None'

    .PARAMETER Value
        The protected value

    .OUTPUTS
        String containing the original secret

    .EXAMPLE
        $json = Unprotect-OktaSecret -Method 'DPAPI' -Value $credential.privateJwkProtected
