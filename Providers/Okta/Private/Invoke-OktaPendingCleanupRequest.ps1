function Invoke-OktaPendingCleanupRequest {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Makes a request that can fail purely because Okta has not finished deleting something

    .DESCRIPTION
        Okta deletes schema-bearing objects asynchronously. The DELETE returns success, the
        object disappears from every listing, and for some seconds afterwards the name is still
        reserved by a background clean-up job. Re-creating it in that window fails.

        This matters here more than it would elsewhere, because the module's normal workflow is
        exactly the thing that triggers it: tear down, then seed again. Both failures were
        reproduced against a live tenant immediately after a teardown, and both went away on
        their own:

        - Custom profile attributes come back as a 400 naming each attribute: "the deletion
          process for an attribute with the same variable name is incomplete. Wait until the
          data clean up process finishes and then try again."
        - A user type comes back as a bare 400 "The request body was not well-formed", which
          says nothing about the real cause and sends you looking for a malformed payload that
          is in fact perfectly valid. The identical body succeeds a few seconds later.

        So this retries on that specific pair of signatures and nothing else. A 400 that means
        what it says is still an immediate failure - retrying every 400 would turn a genuine
        bad request into a slow genuine bad request.
